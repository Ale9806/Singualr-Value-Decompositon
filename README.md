# Singualr Value Decompositon
**SVD can be seen with different glasses:**
1. You could say that SVD is a data driven generalization of the fourier transform.
2. SVD states that any Matrix transformation consists of  a rotation, a strech , and another rotation.
3. SVD is a decomposition into n Rank 1 independent matrices.

All of these are true and to fully undertastand SVD, we neeed to understand the algebra and "geometry" behind it.
The following Repository is a coolection of  professor Steve Brunton's SVD classes  (UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON) and 
it also  includes practical examples from Andrew Ng's machine learning courses (at COURSERA).
